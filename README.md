**A Music player with audio equalizer that analyzes the audio signals and to frequency domain "FFT", and visualizes the energy spectrum with a cool animated wave spectrum video effect. Also this project allows you to filter the audio signal using a high-pass filter, low-pass ..etc**.

>> use this in your projects, giving credits isn't forced but it would be nice. <<

**How to use**: [*Unity 5 or more and another 3d-party audio converter are required*]
1. Download the source code (clone as zip or to github desktop).
2. Open the project with Unity3D.
3. Change the path in the script "MusicPlaylist" to your own music folder. (meanwhile for windows it just reads **'.ogg'** files, so you are gonna have to convert your audio files to ogg using some 3rd party converter hint: "FormatFactory")
**NOTE: on mobile it deals with every single audio file very well. and the path is actually is "mount/SdCard0/Music", you can change that if you want.**
4. you're all sit to go. build and run. (*another problem is the app doesn't cash the audio files in the meantime so it's gonna load all the files everytime you run it, we will try to fix that asap - since tests are coming up don't expect to find it solved in the next few days xD*)
